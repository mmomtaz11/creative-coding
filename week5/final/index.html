    Artist Statement (538 words): The final project was a challenging project for me. It was so open-ended and I’m still new to coding. I didn’t if I was going to be ambition about an idea and not get it done on time. I knew I wanted to do something with a landscape because I enjoyed drawing in code, but I didn’t want to just draw a landscape. I wanted something interactive and with a little more thought put into it. While I was doing my homework, I turned on my lamp and that action sparked an idea. How do we light a space? Why are we turning the light on? The changes that occur when a light is being turned on. It felt like a real-life code. There is a click and something changes. It reminded me of the Ripple project we did. A ripple was only created when you clicked the screen. While brainstorming, I came up with the idea of showing the differences between night and day. I looked up inspiration from the internet and saw that many coders have done the simple house landscape with the changing sky. I wanted to do that but add more to the project. How can I make this simple task more interesting to the viewer? I knew I had to change more than just the sky turning from blue to black with a click. The drawing inspiration came from the Emoji project. I pulled what I learned from that lesson into the final. 

    First, I drew out my daytime landscape which consisted of the sun, grass, and a house. I was very indecisive about the colors I wanted to use, but then ended up going with colors that gave off an 80s videogame. I thought it gave it the flare of the simple tasking of switching between night and day. After that, I added the mousePressed function so the code knew when to switch. I tried to test it with the background first, so I knew that it worked before I coded my whole night landscape. When I did that, it did not work. My background did not change color. I went to YouTube to look up if I was using the function wrong, but all the tutorials said I was using it right. After a lot of frustration, I called my brother who is well-versed in coding. We talked about what I was trying to do and why the mousePressed function was not working. He caught that I didn’t have a variable for daytime. The code would not be able to identify what is daylight and what is nighttime. After our talk, I added the daytime variable. Bringing in inspiration from the Follower project, I added a “if” and “else” statement because I would be able to make daytime true and nighttime false. I added all of the nighttime landscape under “else. My brother told me how to code a false statement which is putting in “= !”. Overall, I’m proud of this project. It took me a long time to code and I was able to overcome my struggles with it. I’m proud that I was able to create a story with the car and the window when the landscape changed to nighttime.
